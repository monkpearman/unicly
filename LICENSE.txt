Portions of this software may directly and/or indirectly derive from
the Common Lisp impmentation of RFC4122 UUIDs after author Boian
Tzonev and as released under the Lisp Lesser GNU Public License
(LLGPL) license with the author asserting All Rights Reserved 2007.
http://opensource.franz.com/preamble.html

We note however that significant portions of Boian Tzonev's
implementation were in turn strongly derived from the non-normative
reference implementation source code included of RFC4122 Appendix C as
a wholly functional C language source code implemention of RFC4122.

We believe the original RFC reference implementation and license have
clear precedent in lieu of the later LLGPL and believe it reasonable
to revert to the spirit of the original permissive and non-LLGPL'd
license included of RFC4122 and as follows:
